# MovieRecommendatonSystem
A movie recommendation system implemented using Streamlit. This project leverages three different recommendation techniques to suggest movies:  Popularity-Based Recommendation, Content-Based Recommendation, Collaborative-Based Recommendation

Popularity-Based Recommendation:

Recommends movies based on their popularity within a specific genre.
Popularity is determined by the number of reviews and average ratings.
Content-Based Recommendation:

Recommends movies similar to a selected movie.
Similarity is based on genres and other features.
Collaborative-Based Recommendation:

Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Uses user ratings to find similar users and suggest movies they liked.
